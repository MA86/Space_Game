# Spaceship Shooter Game

This is a spaceship shooter game prototype. The purpose of this project is to learn low-level graphics libraries such as SDL2 and OpenGL, as well as to learn various game architecture techniques and hierarchy/composition game object model. This project is part of a book that I'm currently reading (see below for name of the book).

## Technologies Used

Python, and SDL2 (Simple Directmedia Layer) which is a low-level 2D/3D programming library similar to OpenGL. Additionally, for the organization of classes, a technique that mixes *hierarchy game object model* and *composition game object model* is applied.

## Demonstration

COMING SOON


Note: All source code for this game prototype can be found inside `.py` files.

*The book I'm currently reading for this project is called, **Game Programming in C++**.*
