# Spaceship Shooter Game

This is a spaceship shooter game prototype. The purpose of this project is to learn low-level graphics/media libraries such as SDL2 and OpenGL. This project is part of a book that I'm currently reading (see below for name of the book).

## Technologies Used

Python, and SDL2 (Simple Directmedia Layer) which is a low-level 2D/3D programming library similar to OpenGL.

## Demonstration

COMING SOON

Note: All source code for this game prototype is inside `.py` files.

*The book I'm currently reading for this project is called, **Game Programming in C++: Creating 3D Games**.*
